# Environment variables reference (sanitized)
#
# This file intentionally redacts secrets and organizes keys by use case so
# AI agents can reason about purpose, scope, and usage without exposing values.
# Replace placeholders in your real environment (.env, CI secrets), not here.


## Database (Server-only)
# Purpose: Primary pooled connection for application runtime via PgBouncer
# Scope: Server (NEVER exposed to client)
# Example shape (no real creds):
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<DB_USER>:<DB_PASSWORD>@<POOLER_HOST>:6543/<DB_NAME>?pgbouncer=true"

# Purpose: Direct connection for admin/migrations (no pooling)
# Scope: Server/CLI only (e.g., Prisma migrations)
# Example shape (no real creds):
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://<DB_USER>:<DB_PASSWORD>@<PRIMARY_HOST>:5432/<DB_NAME>"


## Supabase (Client-safe public + Server)
# Purpose: Supabase project URL
# Scope: Public (can be exposed to client)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://<PROJECT_REF>.supabase.co"

# Purpose: Supabase anonymous public key for client-side access
# Scope: Public, but treat as a credential (rotate if leaked)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="<PUBLIC_ANON_JWT>"


## Conventions
# - Store real values in OS/CI secrets or .env.local (not committed).
# - Public keys prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ may be used by the browser.
# - Server-only secrets must never be referenced in client bundles.
